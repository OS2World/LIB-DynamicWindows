This is a pre-release of Dynamic Windows version 2.4.

The current Dynamic Windows source base is considered stable on:
OS/2, Mac, Windows, Linux, FreeBSD and Solaris.

Known problems:

Boxes with no expandable items will have their contents centered on 
    GTK2 instead of top or left justified on the other platforms.
GTK3 due to changes in the core architecture does not support
    widgets that are smaller than what is contained within them
    unless they use scrolled windows. GTK2 and other platforms do.

Known limitations:

It is not safe on all platforms to operate on widgets before they
are packed.  For portability pack widgets before operating on them.

Future features:

OS/2 is currently missing the HTML widget because the system does 
not support it by default. Looking into importing functionality 
from available libraries (Firefox, Webkit, Qt, etc).

Changes from version 2.3:
Added fullscreen support on Mac for resizable windows.
Added UNICODE build mode on Windows allowing UTF-8 encoded text.
   ANSI builds are supported by removing -DUNICODE -D_UNICODE and -DAEROGLASS
Added some support for antialiased drawing on Windows via GDI+.
